Logic

 

1.       Discount can be applied automatically or manually.

a.       If discount applied manually are added thru the discount button (6.d.).

2.       All discounts are applied before GST.

3.       Automatic discounts uses the following rules.

a.       Rule 1: every Wednesday, all items are less 10% between 2pm - 6pm.

b.      Rule 2: if the total amount of the selected item under Category B is more than or equal to SGD 1,000.00 then apply 40% discount.

                                                               i.      If mixed items are in the table, then just compute the total amount for the Category B.

c.       Rule 3: if its December 20th - 28th , all items under Category E are less 15 SGD.

d.      Rule 4: if the user wants to key-in a manual discount on an item that has currently automatic discount, the system should choose the higher percentage discount.

e.      Rule 5: if the total amount of items chosen for Category A and Category B reaches more than 500 SGD, (meaning Cat A 500 + and Cat B 500 +), then the system will give an additional 50 SGD discount. Meaning to say, items in the transaction need to be more than 500 for each of the categories before this additional $50 is given.
